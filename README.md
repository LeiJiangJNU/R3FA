## Abstract
In this paper proposes a novel and efficient end-to-end 3D face alignment framework.We build an efficient and stable network model through Depthwise Separable Convolution
and Densely Connected Convolutional,named MobDenseNet. Simultaneously,different loss functions are used to constrain 3D parameters based on 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) and 3D vertices

## Training

We train our network using MS-COCO(T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollar, and C. L. Zitnick. Microsoft coco: Common objects in context. In ECCV, 2014. 3-5.) as input images which contains 80000 images and all resize to 256×256 and RGB images are transformed to gray ones. Learning rate is 1×10^(-4). The batch size and epochs are 2 and 4, respectively. Our method is implemented with GTX 1080Ti and 64GB RAM.
